# unauthorized_guide
Once Stripe team gifted me [this](https://press.stripe.com/high-growth-handbook) book, and I got inspired to create my own guide... so here it is ⬇️ 


## **Working with Kasia an unauthorized guide**

**Operating approach**
- Bi-weekly or weekly meetings 1:1s with tracked agenda, actions, goals, and updates.
- Quarterly planning session with good prework and follow up items.
- Regular business & vendors reviews defined OKRs, and platform performance.
- Transparency, feedback, and growth-seeking mindest.

## **Management Style**

**Collaborative**
- I like to discuss decisions & hear opinions and options. 
- I try to provide enough information and contribute as much as I can in requirements, documentation, and explaining why and when. I leave how to the team.
- I like to know what decisions the team took and learning why one but not the other.
- I love documentation and regular status updates. 

**Accountable and organized**
- I take accountability really seriously and expect you to know what yours are, when they are due and get them done. I don’t like chasing them but when things slip it’s fine to renegotiate deadlines when it’s not after the deadline.

**Data-driven**
- I love data, dashboards, numbers, tracking, and monitoring. 
- If we are discussing something that can be supported by data please bring it forward.

**Intuitive**
- One of my strengths is good intuition and it helps me 

**Strategic**
- Approach how we get from point A to B in the most efficient way. Always trying to learn “What problem are we trying to solve?” ...What, when, who, why...

**User-oriented**
- Personally, I strongly believe we should listen to our users and build for them

### **Communication**
- 1:1s
- I like having an agenda and a list of topics we want to discuss.
- If we don’t have  1:1 for a while. Feel free to drop something on the calendar.

**Email**
- I will read every email I get in a day and respond when there is an action needed on my end.
- I love FYI emails about projects, changes, successes. 

**Chat & pings**
- This is the most preferable way of getting my attention for any urgent, important and timely asks.

**Feedback**
- I strongly believe that without the feedback we cannot get better. I like giving it and receiving it.   

### **Management and people**
- I get my motivation and inspiration from people I work with. I love the feeling of contribution and seeing growth and success. 

**Results**
- Let’s get good results and try to measure our work.

**Humor**
- Last but not least, I love a good sense of humor, laughs, and having fun at work. 


## **And here is a cool PM Process  which I learned at the HBS**
- Define the problem
- Determine the requirements
- Set goals for the process improvement
- Map the current process
- Determine the critical-to-quality (CTQ)  outputs and characteristics of the process
- Select and agree on metrics to improve CTQ
- Collect data to determine the baselines
- Analyze the data from the measuring step
- Do a GAP analysis
- Find the root cause of the problematic area in the process
- Consider alternative approaches to solve the problem
- Assess the cost, benefit, impact, and risk of each alternative
- Find the best approach
- Create a plan and implement improvements
- Conduct a pilot and test the solutions
- Create CTQ metrics from the pilot and analyze
- Publicize the solutions amongst the relevant teams
- Standardize and institutionalize the new process
- Put the proper tools in place to sustain improvement gains
- Monitor the process for any "out of control" conditions
- Schedule retrospective to keep improving
